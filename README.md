## Deep_Learning_in_8_weeks
### Week 1 
#### Basics of Soft Computing(Neural Networks) to Building a Neural Network
- #### Introduction To Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) -
    - Watch the Introductory Videos To Neural Networks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWaow1Rvho&list=PLxt59R_fWVzT9bDxA76AHm3ig0Gg9S3So) and read Part 1 of the Deep Learning Book. 
     [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). Download the Full Book from [here](https://github.com/soumyadip1995/deep-learning-by-ian-goodfellow-full-pdf/blob/master/deeplearningbook.pdf) if you wish to.
     - To see Artificial Neural Networks in Action, view the Ipython Notebook [here](https://github.com/soumyadip1995/Deep_Learning_in_8_weeks/blob/master/Week%201%20Notebooks/part1.ipynb) and Blog post [here](https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/scikit-learn/Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-1-Introduction.php)
 - #### Multi-Layer Perceptron Model and McCulloch-Pitts Neuron
      - Read this Blog Post [here](https://skymind.ai/wiki/multilayer-perceptron) and Watch this video by Daniel Shiffmann right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5GAVdLQyIg&t=16s). Also read about McCulloch-Pitts Neuron [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/mcculloch-pitts-model-5fdf65ac5dd1)
      - View The Jupyter Notebook on the usage of MLP on kaggle's MNIST dataset [here](https://github.com/soumyadip1995/Deep_Learning_in_8_weeks/blob/master/Week%201%20Notebooks/Kaggle-MNIST-Multilayer-Perceptron.ipynb)
      
 -  #### Building a Neural Network
      - [Build a Neural Network in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ) by Siraj Raval
      - Type out the neural network code yourself in a text editor, compile, and run it locally (using no ML libraries)

### Week 2
#### Forward Propagation, BackPropagation and Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
- [Forward Propagation](https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/scikit-learn/Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-2-Forward-Propagation.php) Blogpost. You will Find its application as well. 
- Read the [Gradient Descent](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/introduction-to-gradient-descent-algorithm-along-its-variants/) Blogpost. Watch [ Backpropagation in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q555kfIFUCM) by Siraj Raval.
